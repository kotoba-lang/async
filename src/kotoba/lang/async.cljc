(ns kotoba.lang.async
  "Bounded channels as pure state machines. Layer 2 (cap/effect) of the kotoba
  foundational stdlib.

  The kotoba-WASM premise (no threads, no wall clock) rules out core.async
  go-blocks and tokio-style runtimes. This lib models a channel as plain EDN
  state and `put` / `take` as `[new-state result]` transitions a host or durable
  loop threads through — the 'bounded state-machine channel' the
  foundational-stdlib ADR specified. It composes with the durable outer loop
  (lease / tick / budget) in CLAUDE.md without inventing a runtime.

  Buffer semantics (matching core.async):
  - :fixed    — put is not accepted when full (the caller would block); take
                removes from the front.
  - :dropping — put is always accepted; when full the NEW value is discarded
                (buffer unchanged).
  - :sliding  — put is always accepted; when full the OLDEST value is dropped
                (front removed) and the new value appended.

  Zero third-party runtime deps; .cljc (JVM / SCI / CLJS / GraalVM / kotoba-WASM).

  AUTHORITY AND LOAD PATH (ADR 0001, amended 2026-08-13 by ADR-2608130900).

  `src/kotoba/lang/async.kotoba` is the semantic authority: it is the sovereign
  Kotoba program, and it is what the typed-ABI, restricted-JavaScript and
  typed-Wasm conformance tests execute. This `.cljc` is the *load path*.
  `kotoba-lang/scheduler` requires this namespace from `src/` (not only from
  its tests), and no Clojure/ClojureScript/nbb loader can require a `.kotoba`.
  Between 2026-07-20 and 2026-08-13 this file did not exist; see ADR-2608071000
  (which found the same class of breakage in `kotoba-lang/dsl-core`) and
  ADR-2608130900. The two are held in agreement by
  `test/kotoba/lang/async_parity_test.clj`.

  TWO DIVERGENCES FROM THE GUEST, BOTH DELIBERATE AND BOTH STATED:

  1. Capacity. The guest restricts capacity to 1..32, because a document
     container holds at most 32 items — that is the KIR value budget, not a
     decision about channels. This namespace has no upper bound, because the
     only consumer, `kotoba-lang/scheduler`, opens its ready queue as
     `(a/chan :dropping 64)` (`scheduler.cljc:25`). The guest cannot represent
     that channel at all. Narrowing the `.cljc` to match would not be parity;
     it would be breaking the consumer to flatter the port. The parity gate
     therefore asserts agreement for capacities 1..32 and asserts explicitly
     that the guest refuses 0 and 33+ while this namespace accepts them.
  2. Failure mechanism. The guest fails closed by trapping (surfacing as
     `ExceptionInfo` at the execution boundary); this namespace throws
     `ex-info`. Both refuse an unknown buffer kind or a non-positive capacity.

  Two behaviours below are the guest's, NOT the 2026-07-20 original's, because
  the guest is the authority and its versions are right:

  - `can-put?` on a closed channel is `false`. The original returned `true`
    for a closed non-full fixed channel while `put` refused it — the two
    disagreed with each other, and the guest settled it.
  - `closed?` returns a boolean rather than whatever was in the map."
